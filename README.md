Constraint Programming for the Vehicle Assignment Problem
The vehicle assignment problem is a typical example of constraint programming (CP), where the goal is to assign a set of vehicles to tasks or routes while respecting a set of specific constraints. Within CP, this problem can be formulated to optimize vehicle usage, taking into account constraints such as capacities, schedules, costs, and preferences.
# Decision Variables
Each vehicle and each task must be represented by variables:
    Vehicles: Each vehicle can be represented by a variable, with characteristics such as capacity, usage cost, or vehicle type.
    Tasks / Routes: For each task (or route) to be accomplished, a variable can be created representing the vehicle that will be assigned to that task.
# Domain of Variables
Each variable will have a domain of possible values:
    Vehicle Domain: Each task can be assigned to one of the available vehicles.
    Task Domain: This can include the locations to be served, schedules, and other specifications.
# Constraints
The constraints of the problem are formulated to ensure the feasibility of the assignment. Examples include:
    Capacity: A vehicle must not exceed its maximum capacity when tasks are assigned.
    Availability: Some vehicles may be unavailable during specific periods.
    Costs: Minimize the costs associated with vehicle usage (fuel, maintenance, etc.).
    Task Type Constraints: Certain tasks may require specific vehicles (e.g., refrigerated vehicles for perishable goods).
    Schedules: Vehicles must adhere to the time slots of tasks.
# Objective Function
If the goal is to optimize the assignment (e.g., minimize costs, maximize vehicle utilization), an objective function can be defined:
    Cost Minimization: Reduce operational costs while meeting the requirements of all tasks.
    Resource Utilization Optimization: Ensure a balanced use of the vehicle fleet.
